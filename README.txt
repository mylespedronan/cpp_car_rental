This is a project for a Car Rental System in C++. A user is able to manage car records such as adding, updating, removing, listing all, checking, renting, and returning cars. Data is stored in a JSON file using nlohmann's json library [https://github.com/nlohmann/json]. 

The basic features of the car rental system are:

- Add Car (Takes inputs of car details [model, year, new/used, available/not available])
- Update Car Details (Updates details of car in the car records [cost, how many times rented, damages])
- Remove Car (Clears existing record of a car)
- List all cars (Show all available cars)
- Check Car (Check car data)
- Rent a Car 
- Return a car
